# Employee Directory

A [Employee Directory](https://jmasaviru.github.io/Employee-Directory/) that allows the user (perhaps an employee or manager) to view the whole directory giving quick access to non-sensitive employee information. The user is able to sort employees alphabetically ascending or descending and also filter employees by searching for their name.
